      <p>There are miles between us, but not a single inch of space in my heart that isnâ€™t filled with you.</p>
      <p>Youâ€™ve become my favorite thought in the quiet moments, my comfort on the hard days, and my joy in all the ones in between. Even from a distance, you feel close â€” like sunlight through a window or a song that never stops playing in my head.</p>
      <p>I donâ€™t need to be beside you to feel how deeply I love you. I just do â€” endlessly, quietly, and with a kind of certainty I never expected but now couldnâ€™t live without.</p>
      <p>Happy Birthday, Zoey. You deserve all the beauty in the world, and Iâ€™ll spend my days trying to make sure you feel just that â€” adored, seen, and deeply loved.</p>
      <p class="signature">Until weâ€™re close again,<br> Iâ€™m yours. Always. Waiting.<br><span>â€” Tas</span></p>
